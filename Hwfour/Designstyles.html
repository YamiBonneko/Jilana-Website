 <p> <li> Shown on here they advertise their merchandise very neatly shown as all of their pictures perfectly align. <br> Same thing wih the name boxes on the bottom they are all aligned. </br> </p> 
 <p> <li> This is another example of alignment but with a different shape of a circle. <br> This gives the website some variety of usuing different shape layouts but at the same time keeping it organized. </br> </li> </p>
 <p> <li> The layout is shown horizontally for products which is easy to browse through. <br> While shopping it makes easier for customers. </br> </li> </p>
