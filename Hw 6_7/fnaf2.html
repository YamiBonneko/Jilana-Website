         <p>“They lied to us. They lied to all of us. They told us that the whole point of this VR game was to undo the bad PR done by a rogue indie game developer, who supposedly made up a bunch of crazy stories that tarnished the brand. 
          <br> But that’s not true at all! In their haste to develop this VR game and clear their name, they sent us some things I don’t think they intended us to see. Such as a hard drive containing e-mails between Fazbear Entertainment and a certain indie developer. Fazbear Entertainment hired the game developer. Those indie games were designed to conceal and make light of what happened. This isn’t just an attempt to rebrand. It’s an elaborate cover-up. A campaign to discredit everything.”</p>

         <p> “There is a way to kill it. It wants to escape. To escape through someone. Someone plugged into this game. That's...you now... You have to let it begin the process of leaving through you, then use the disconnect switch that I've embedded by the main stage. 
           <br> Let it approach you. Let it begin to merge with you. Play the music and flip the switch. That will cause a hard restart of the game and flush the memory, effectively killing it, I hope. I don't know when it will come for you.”</p>
