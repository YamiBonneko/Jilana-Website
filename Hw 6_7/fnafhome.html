      <h4>My Inspirations and thoughts into the website!</h4>
      
      <br>
      <br>

      <p class ="fnafhome"> My main inspiration for my website design is the Chuck e Cheese and John's Incredible pizza website.
        <br> It's advertised for kids and is built like a party site so I decided to take inspiration from those sites for aesthetic purposes.
        <br> One of the worst websites I had inspiration from is from Angie's project which is was about language. She had a fixed image 
        <br> on her site and how she laid out her website I liked that so took some inspo from that. I tried to keep the pages a consistent theme according to the site.
        <br> For example, my first page is supposed to be like the Pizzeria's offical page, it appears normal but the videos included lead to a darker secret about it, same for the mega Pizzaplex
        <br> page it is set to have an 80s vibe but the gif of the unsettling rabbit following you is supposed to be like that she hacked the site and is looking straight at you.
        <br> For the official entertainment site I included it to look like the company's offical site but easter eggs are hidden around the site. Added the review part to include my analysis disguised as a review lol. </p class= "fnafhome">

        <br>
        My website ended up looking silly but the way I laid them out made it have some kind of structure. I made some jokes on the sites using some memes.
        <br> At the same time it came out into something I envisioned it to be which was having it feel like an old website that are promoting these attractions,
        but having it have some creepy elements to the videos that I added. <br> I wanted each website to all have a sort of color scheme but made it a but obnoxious with the random
        <br> texts and gifs alluding to the game in my websites and crazy placements making it look like a chaoic site.

        <H4> Design Styles you attempted to exaggerate </H4>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="fnafhome"> I've exaggerated the crazy placement and random texts and gifs around the page. 
        <br> I loved adding the repeated moving gif background to make the page feel more alive and add to the chaos.
        <br> I tried adding audio to play on my website but it sadly doesn't work, I wanted to have audio being able to play from the game. </p class="fnafhome">

        <H4> Web attributes that annoyed me </H4>

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p class="fnafhome"> Some things that annoyed me about my webpage was how some of my ideas didn't really work such as the audio.
        
        <br> 
        
        I had some issues as well with image movement and placement there were only really guides on how to move it left right or having it centered
        <br> I wanted the pictures to be more randomly placed. </p class="fnafhome">
