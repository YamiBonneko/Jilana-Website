      <h4>My Inspirations and thoughts into the website!</h4>
      
      <br>
      <br>

      <p> My main inspiration for my website design is the Chuck e Cheese and John's Incredible pizza website.
        <br> It's advertised for kids and is built like a party site so I decided to take inspiration from those sites for aesthetic purposes.
        <br> One of the worst websites I had inspiration from is from Angie's project which is was about language. She had a fixed image 
        <br> on her site and how she laid out her website I liked that so took some inspo from that. I tried to keep the pages a consistent theme according to the site.
        <br> For example, my first page is supposed to be like the Pizzeria's offical page, it appears normal but the videos included lead to a darker secret about it, same for the mega Pizzaplex
        <br> page it is set to have an 80s vibe but the gif of the unsettling rabbit following you is supposed to be like that she hacked the site and is looking straight at you.
        <br> For the official entertainment site I included it to look like the company's offical site but easter eggs are hidden around the site. Added the review part to include my analysis disguised as a review lol.
